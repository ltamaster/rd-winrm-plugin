## Rd-WinRM-plugin
This is a [Rundeck Node Execution plugin](http://rundeck.org/docs/plugins-user-guide/node-execution-plugins) that uses WinRM to connect to Windows and execute commands. It uses the [WinRM for Ruby](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM)Library to provide the WinRM implementation.

Compatible with Rundeck 2.9.x+

## Features
Can run scripts or commands.  
Supports PowerShell, CMD and WQL shells    
Can copy files to Windows  

### Installation

Install Ruby:  
Ubuntu: `apt-get install make ruby ruby-dev`  
CentOS/RHEL: `yum install make ruby ruby-devel`

Install following gems:  
`gem install winrm -v 2.2.3`  
`gem install winrm-fs -v 1.0.2`  
`gem install rubyntlm -v 0.6.2`  

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/NetDocuments/rd-winrm-plugin/releases).

Copy the `rd-winrm-plugin.zip` to the `libext/` directory for Rundeck. It must be named like `rd-winrm-plugin-x.x.x.zip`. There is no need to restart rundeck.

```bash
RD_WINRM='1.7.0'
curl https://github.com/NetDocuments/rd-winrm-plugin/archive/$RD_WINRM.zip -o /var/lib/rundeck/libext/rd-winrm-plugin-$RD_WINRM.zip
```

Before rundeck can run commands on windows nodes, [configure winrm](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff700227.aspx) from an administrative powershell window

    winrm quickconfig

### Configuration
Choose `WinRM Executor` as Default Node Executor  
and `WinRM File Copier` as Default Node File Copier   

Settings:  
`Kerberos Realm`  Put here fqdn of your realm in case your computer is part of AD domain  
`Username` Put here username for negotiate, plaintext or ssl auth  
`Password` Put here password for negotiate, plaintext or ssl auth  
`Auth type` Choose here negotiate, kerberos, plaintext or ssl  
`NOSSL` Choose to disable SSL Validation  
`Allow override` Allow override of variables from job options  
`WinRM transport protocol` Set protocol for winrm transport (Default: http)
`WinRM port` Set port for winrm (Default: 5985/5986 for http/https)  
`Shell` Choose here powershell, cmd or wql  
`WinRM timeout` Put here timeout in seconds (useful for long running commands)

### Special Behaviour
`Allow Override` parameter gives possibility to set hostname, username and password in job options, not in project. It can be used in case you need to quickly change hostnames (with dropdown list for example) or set username/pass on job level  

- If that parameter set to `hostname` you may use option variable with name `winrmhost` to set hostname
- If that parameter set to `user` you may use `winrmuser` and `winrmpass` to set username/pass
- If that parameter set to `all` you may use all these additional options
- If that parameter set to `none` these options in jobs will be ignored

### Limitations
- Scripts in c:/tmp with .sh extension will be renamed into .ps1, .bat or .wql
- Quotes behaviour can be strange, [Rundeck bug](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues/602)

### Troubleshooting
You may have some errors like ```WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError```.  
You can run the following commands on the server to try to solve the problem:

```
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
```
You can read more about that on issue [#29](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM/issues/29) on ruby WinRM page
